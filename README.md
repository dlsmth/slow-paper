# Slow Paper

A simple code doodle, fizz buzz variation & somewhat meta art project (and placeholder, to be honest) that utilizes CSS & JavaScript to slowly animate & build a simple piece of a paper, programmatically.

It utilizes simple Element creation & DOM addition, alongside a timer, and some basic CSS styling. It's responsive, as well.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
